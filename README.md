# Working with Local Branches

## Learning Goals

- Create a branch
- Add and commit changes
- Push a branch

## Introduction

Many developers and organizations use Git branches to keep track of their work.
Itâ€™s important that we understand how to work with branches on both our local
machine _as well as_ on a shared resource, like GitHub. Being able to share
branches means that all the advantages of branch-based development are
available both for individuals ***and*** organizations.

## Create a Branch

We'll get started by _branching_ on a local Git repository.

By default, we start on the `master` branch. To create a new branch from the branch
we are currently "on," we type the command:

```bash
git branch new-branch-name
```

This will create a local branch called `new-branch-name`. If we type
`git branch`, we will see all the branches.

```shell
$ git branch
* master
  new-branch-name
```

You'll notice the `*` next to `master`. That's Git telling us that we're
still "on" master. If we make a new commit, it will go on `master`. We
need to get "on" `new-branch-name`. To do this we "check out" the
new branch like so: `git checkout new-branch-name`.

Running `git branch` confirms our "movement."

```shell
$ git checkout new-branch-name
$ git branch
  master
* new-branch-name
```

If we want to create a new branch _and_ move onto that branch in a single
command, we can use:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

To switch to any branch that we're not currently on we use:

```bash
git checkout other-branch-name
```

As a shortcut, we can switch **back to the previous** branch using:

```bash
git checkout -
```

As we can see, we now have a copy of all of our original branch's progress in
our new branch.

Here's the log of commits on `master`. We'll learn more about the log later,
but right now it shows us that the last commit was commit `08c0087...` (Yep,
commits are named 128-character long strings made up of numbers and the letters
`a` through `f`).

And on new branch, we see that the last commit was our friend `08c0087...`
They're identical!

## Add and Commit Changes

Now that we've created a new branch, which is our place to safely make changes,
let's make some modifications to this branch.  First, we're going to make
changes in our `README.md` and save them. Try adding your name to the top line
of `README.md` and save the file, if you're following along. We'll make many
more changes.

> **REMEMBER**: To confirm that changes have been made, we can always check by
> using `git status`. You're going to use this ***all the time***.

!["git status"](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/prework/git-workflow/git%20status.gif)

Now that the file has changed from its original state, we can _stage_ these changes,
which tells Git that we want to keep track of changes to this file.

We made a few changes throughout the file and want to see what changed, so we
will review changes in "chunks" using `git add -p`. We can stage each change,
or pass over others that we don't want. Git will guide us to each "chunk" of
changed content and confirm with us whether to stage or not to stage the
"chunk" of change.

!["git add -p"](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/prework/git-workflow/git%20add%20p.gif)

If we **know** we want all the **changes in a file** we can add the whole file:

```bash
git add file-name
```

And if we **know** we want ***all the changes in all the files in our current directory***, we can use:

```bash
git add .
```

Lastly, if we want all the changes to all the files in a sub-directory, we can
use:

```bash
git add images/.
```

> **QUESTION**: Why not ***always*** use `git add .`? When developing we often make more
> changes than we remember. We might make changes that weren't part of the fix or we might
> accidentally write our TODO list inside of a code file. Adding piece-by-piece gives us
> a chance to make sure we want to add everything Git knows has changed. We can use the
> other approaches when needed, but you might commit some junk. Developers say
> __"commit small, commit often."__ There are even more advanced Git tools that will help
> you debug your code and find mistakes and they work better with smaller, more-frequent
> commit histories.

Now that we have some staged changes ready for our branch, we will want to make a new
commit. To commit the changes that have been staged so far we use:

```bash
git commit -m <message>
```

The `-m` flag allows us to add message along with the commit. These messages
are the best way to give context about a change to our future selves or other
developers. Messages should be brief but informative. Avoid messages like
'pleasework', 'totally broken', 'y u no work', 'i hate ruby'. Git history is
hard to delete and you might regret a colleague or prospective employer reading
your commits of desperation.  Typically, we want to limit the message to 50
characters explaining what changed:

!["Git Commit with Message"](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/prework/git-workflow/git%20commit.gif)

If we leave off the `-m` flag, Git will ask your operating system which editor
you have configured the Git to use to edit your commit messages. Git will open
the editor and load it with a pre-filled text file to edit. When you save and
quit from your editor, Git will use this message as the commit.

When getting started, it's wisest to use `-m`. For significant commits you'll
leave off `-m` intentionally so that you have a document to edit which captures
the changes, motivations, bug report URLs, etc. By default, Git will reach for
the venerable `vim` editor for editing your messages. To make Git use the Atom
editor, instead you can tell Git to do so with the following command:

```bash
$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

Here we configured Git to use `atom` as the editor for commit messages.

## Push a Branch

We've created a new branch, committed some changes, and now we should push this
branch up to our remote repo, a GitHub repo. The `git push` command takes two
arguments: The remote name: commonly `origin`, and the branch name: commonly
`master`.

The remote `origin` is the conventional name for the default remote.  Just like
how `master` is the default name for the default branch.

If we have a branch that does not exist on the remote repository, we use:

```bash
git push -u origin new-branch-name
```

If the branch exists on the remote, as in we've used the previous command before,
we can simply use `git push`.

Git push without flag:

Git push with flag (`-u` is the same as `--set-upstream`):

!["git push -u"](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/prework/git-workflow/git%20push%20u.gif)

## Conclusion

Branching allows developers to make edits to a code base while isolating their
work from other work. We can create branches, back them up to remote locations,
and continue to work with them locally.
